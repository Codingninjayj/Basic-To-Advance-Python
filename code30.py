# Python Sets
# Sets are unordered collection of data items. They store multiple items in a single variable. Set items are separated by commas and enclosed within curly brackets {}. Sets are unchangeable, meaning you cannot change items of the set once created. Sets do not contain duplicate items.

# Example:
s={1,5,3,2,1,4,2,1}
print(s)

#Example
info = {"Carla", 19, False, 5.9, 19}
print(info)

#Example:
yash=set()
print(type(yash))


# Accessing set items:
# Using a For loop
# You can access items of set using a for loop.

# Example:
for value in info:
    print(value)
